;;;; ======= Explicitize transformation ============================================================
;;;
;;; Makes intermediate values explicit by assigning them to named variables.
;;; An intermediate value is any value that is passed to an operator or
;;; function that was produced by another operator or function.
;;; We make exceptions for values that are produced by operators applied
;;; to non-function-calls.  So in the code
;;;   bar(50 + foo())
;;; the expression `foo()` produces an intermediate value that will be
;;; explicitly named.  However, in the similar code
;;;   bar(50 + 100)
;;; we don't treat `50 + 100` as producing an intermediate value, because
;;; it is an operator applied to two constants.  Same goes for `50 + x`
;;; in the code
;;;   bar(50 + x)
;;;
;;; As a convenience, the explicitize transformation also breaks up
;;; var-decl-statements that contain more than one var-decl into multiple
;;; single-decl var-decl-statements.  So
;;;   var x = 10, y = 20
;;; will become
;;;   var x = 10;
;;;   var y = 20;

;;;; ======= Implementation note ===================================================================
;;;
;;; The explicitize transformation has a more complicated protocol than most of
;;; the other transformations, so the TRANSFORM method is just a thin wrapper that
;;; calls a separate generic function called TX-EXPLICITIZE and translates the
;;; results to the TRANSFORM protocol.
;;;
;;; Sometimes a source-element will be in a position
;;; in the code where it can be replaced with a series of new statements.  Ex:
;;;
;;;   echo('hello', newline());
;;;
;;; can legally be replaced by
;;;
;;;   var JW0 = newline();
;;;   echo('hello', JW0);
;;;
;;; However, at other times, a statement will be "nested" in such a way that it
;;; is /not/ legal to replace it with a series of arbitrary statements (this is
;;; usually when it is nested into an expression).  In this code
;;;
;;;   return process('hello', newline()) + process('seeya', newline());
;;;
;;; the first call to `process` cannot be replaced with an arbitrary list of
;;; statements.  Instead, we can place some "prerequisite" statements before the
;;; entire return statement, and represent the value that results from executing
;;; the prerequisites by a "proxy" variable that will be defined as part of the
;;; prerequisites:
;;;
;;;   var JW0 = newline();
;;;   var JW1 = process('hello', JW0);
;;;   var JW2 = newline();
;;;   var JW3 = process('seeya', JW2);
;;;   return JW1 + JW3;
;;;
;;; In this case, `JW1` is the proxy for the first call to process, and `JW3` is
;;; the proxy for the second call to process.
;;;
;;; The main job of the explicitization transformation is to make sure that every
;;; function call in a nested context is replaced with a proxy variable.
;;;
;;; Since the fn-call method needs to return a proxy with prerequisites when it
;;; is in a nested context, but may return a function call (possibly also with
;;; some prerequisites) in a non-nested context, we need some way to tell it whether
;;; it is in a nested context or not.  We use the dynamic variable *NESTED-CONTEXT*
;;; to track this information (see next section comment).
;;;
;;; The TX-EXPLICITIZE transformation function returns 2 values.
;;; The first value is a source-element that should go wherever the original element
;;; lived in the parse tree.  I refer to this as the "proxy" value, even though it
;;; isn't always a proxy (it may just be a transformed version of the original element).
;;;
;;; The second value is a list of "prerequisite" statements that should go before the
;;; innermost enclosing non-nested statement (which may be this statement).

;;;; ======= Sub-expression protocol ===============================================================
;;;
;;; Transformations are responsible for knowing whether they are nested within subexpressions
;;; or not, and therefore whether they should return using a proxy.  For example, the element
;;;    foo(bar());
;;; should return `foo(JWn);` with prereqs of `var JWn = bar();` when it is
;;; not nested.  However, when it /is/ nested, it should return `JWn` with prereqs
;;; of `var JWm = bar(); var JWn = foo(JWm);`.
;;;
;;; In order for the methods of TX-EXPLICITIZE to know whether they are in a nested
;;; context or not, we bind *NESTED-CONTEXT* to T when calling TX-EXPLICITIZE on nested expressions.

;;TODO I'm not sure I like the term "nested".  Better ideas, anyone?
