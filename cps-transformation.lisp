;;;; CPS transformation
;;; Initial, naive version does the following:
;;; - All function calls transformed to fn-calls in continuation-passing style
;;; - All new expressions transformed to new expressions that pass a continuation as the first argument
;;; - All assignments to function call or `new` results transformed to new continuations
;;; - All returns transformed to returns of the arg passed to the current continuation
;;; - TODO describe loop conversions in more detail
;;; - TODO describe try-catch conversions in more detail
;;;
;;;; Preconditions
;;; The CPS transform assumes the following:
;;; 1. Scope analysis transformation has been performed (and therefore all identifiers are unique)
;;; 2. Explicitization transformation has been performed (and therefore all result values have an
;;;    explicit and unique name).
;;; 3. The loop transformation has been performed, so all loops have been transformed to canonical
;;;    while form.

;; These elements should have been removed by LOOP-TO-FUNCTION

;;;; Statement tails 
;;;
;;; A "statement tail" is a list of the statements that follow the current
;;; statement in the current scope.  Note that this can include statements
;;; from an enclosing scope as well.  For example, in the following code:
;;;
;;;     function foo(opt)
;;;     {
;;;       if(opt)
;;;       {
;;;         foo(x);
;;;         bar(x);
;;;         baz(opt);
;;;       }
;;;       else
;;;       {
;;;         bar(0);
;;;       } 
;;;
;;;       quux();
;;;       quuux();
;;;     }
;;;
;;;     doThis();
;;;     doThat();
;;;
;;; the statement-tail of the `foo(x)` call is (`bar(x)`, `baz(opt)`, `quux()`, `quuux()`).
;;; Note that `quux()` and `quuux()` are in the statement-tail, but `dothis()` and `dothat()`
;;; are not.  The statement-tail will never extend past the end of the innermost enclosing
;;; function declaration.
;;;
;;; Basically, the statement-tail contains all of the statements that should go into a continuation,
;;; should we need to generate a continuation at this point.
;;;

;;;; ======= TRANSFORM method ======================================================================
;;;
;;; As with the explicitization transformation, the cps transformation has a fairly
;;; complicated protocol, so the TRANSFORM method is just a thin wrapper over the
;;; TX-CPS generic function.

;;; Backchannel return values are sent on channel :BARE-VAR-DECL-REQUIRED by the

;;; at the beginning of the neared enclosing scope.  These backchannel messages are
;;; collected by the FUNCTION-DECL and FUNCTION-EXPRESSION methods, as well as by

     2) 'Null clauses' (ie, clauses with no body) are also returned unchanged so long as they aren't
